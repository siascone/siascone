### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer consumed by nature and music. I have a background in contemporary composition and a passion for the environment.

Whether making music, crafting renewable projects or repurposing electronics, I have a creative solutions side to me that I have always enjoyed exploring and I am happy I am able to do that with software engineering. 

I love learning new technologies and the logic and creative challenges that come along with those technologies and I am always up for a good bug hunt. 

Happy coding!
