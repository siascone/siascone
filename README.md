### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer consumed by nature, sound and how things work. I have a background in contemporary composition and a passion for the environment.

Whether making music, crafting DIY projects or repurposing electronics, I have a creative solutions side that I have always enjoyed exploring and I am happy I get to do that with software engineering. 

I love learning new technologies and exploring the logic and creative challenges that come along with them and I am always up for a good bug hunt. 

Happy coding!

-Spencer
